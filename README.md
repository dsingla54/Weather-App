# Weather-App

The Weather App is a web application that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for a specific city. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays essential weather details, including temperature, weather type, and description, in a user-friendly interface.

**Features:**

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features a visually appealing and responsive design that provides a seamless user experience.
  
- **Dynamic Animation:** The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is used to create a bouncing animation effect, enhancing the visual appeal of the interface.

- **Weather Data Retrieval:** Users can enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Show" button to fetch weather information for that city.

- **Weather Display:** The fetched weather data is displayed in the designated area on the webpage, providing users with relevant weather details.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the webpage and its elements.
  
- **CSS:** Handles the styling of UI elements, ensuring a visually appealing design.
  
- **JavaScript:** Manages the logic for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displaying it on the webpage.
  
- **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP):** Provides dynamic animations to enhance the user interface.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Open the `1.html` file in a web browser to launch the Weather App.

3. Enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Show" button to retrieve weather information for that city.

**API Key:**

To use the Weather App, you'll need to replace the `apiKey` variable in the `weather.js` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your API key
```
